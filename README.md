Gimp3 segany.py is a copy of the work by Shrinivas Kulkarni, modified and refined to be a Gimp3.0 plugin.  While I do have the basics of the plugin code complete, and the GUI popups work, the physical code mechanics of the Segment Anything (SAM2.1) library are just broken in its current state.   The goal is to eventually have a gimp3.0 plugin that performed like Shrinivas Kulkarni gimp2 plugin, but as I learned while building this project, it was more than I expected.  Anyway, here is the code ready for your modifications and code cleanup :-)   Also read the text content of the file sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth for downloading this trained file.
